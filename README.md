# IDS-Sparse-Autoencoder
This repository contains the implementation of an anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed for Internet of Things (IoT) networks, utilizing a Sparse Autoencoder for efficient feature extraction and anomaly detection. The project supports a research paper focused on enhancing IoT security by detecting network intrusions through deep learning techniques.

Project Overview

The system processes IoT network traffic data to identify anomalous behavior, addressing the limitations of traditional signature-based IDS in detecting zero-day attacks. It leverages a Sparse Autoencoder to reduce data dimensionality and extract significant features, followed by classification to detect intrusions. The code is modularized for clarity and reproducibility, handling data loading, preprocessing, and visualization tasks.

Dataset

The code is designed to work with IoT network traffic datasets, such as UNSW-IoT or Bot-IoT. https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/bot-iot-dataset
